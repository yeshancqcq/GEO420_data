This file contains the following tabs:"1. ""METADATA"": metadata for each proxy record. PLEASE CITE THE ORIGINAL AUTHORS WHEN USING THEIR DATA.""2. ""TEMPERATURE STACKS"": the global/regional temperature stacks given as anomalies from the AD 1961-1990 mean.""3. ""HOLOCENE FREQ DIST"": Holocene temperature anomaly (from AD 1961-1990 mean) frequency distributions based on various versions of the stack in 0.05°„C bins, as shown in Figure 3 in the manuscript.""4. Tabs containing raw data for each proxy record. Age models, proxy values, and calibrated temperatures are shown on the left side of each tab, and radiocarbon data are given on the right side."    Tabs are named according to core/site name and are listed in the order provided in the METADATA tab (ie number column).Age model information:"All ages are given in yr BP, where Present = 1950 AD. Age models were constructed with focus on the Holocene interval (11.3-0 ka). They should be used with ""caution outside of this time window.  Ages were linearly extrapolated beyond bottommost dates, and assumed to be 0 yr BP at core tops unless otherwise noted in the original publication. "Recalculated age models begin either at 11.3 ka or their bottommost radiocarbon date. All radiocarbon dates were calculated with Calib6.0. Both the linearly interpolated IntCal09and Monte Carlo based age model uncertainties used in this study are provided.  Radiocarbon dates and recalculated age models based on tuning were not used in this study. Excluded age control points are shown in red. Radiocarbon dates without published errors are noted as are assumed uncertainties (1¶“). Local reservoir corrections (¶§R) "and uncertainty were assumed to be 0 when input into Calib6.0 if not otherwise stated in the original publication (denoted by ""-"" in file).  Any depths with multiple proxy ""measurements were averaged and combined into a single measurement.  See Marcott et al.,  for more detail on age model construction."
