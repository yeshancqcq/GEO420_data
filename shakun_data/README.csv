This file contains the following tabs:"1. ""TEMPERATURE STACKS"": the global, hemispheric, and hemispheric difference temperature stacks, given as anomalies from their early Holocene (11.5-6.5 ka) mean.""2. ""METADATA"": metadata for each proxy record""3. Tabs containing raw data for each proxy record. Age models, proxy values, and calibrated temperatures are shown on the left side of each tab, and radiocarbon data are given on the right side."    Tabs are named according to core/site name and are listed sequentially in order by latitude.Age model information:"All ages are given in yr BP, where Present = 1950 AD. Age models were constructed with focus on the deglacial interval (22-6.5 ka). They should be used with ""caution outside of this time window (e.g., ages near core tops were not constrained to be greater than 0 yr BP). Ages were linearly extrapolated beyond top and "bottommost dates using the mean sedimentation rate over the dated section of the core. Recalculated age models begin either at 30 ka or their bottommost radiocarbon date. The IntCal04 calibration begins at 26 cal. kyr BP; IntCal04 age models in the following tabs extending beyond 26 cal. kyr BP were calibrated using IntCal09. Radiocarbon dates and recalculated age models are not provided for age models based on tuning. Excluded radiocarbon dates are shown in red. Radiocarbon dates without published errors were assumed to have 1% errors (1¦Ò). Local reservoir corrections (¦¤R) were assumed to be 0 if not otherwise stated "in the original publication. See Shakun et al., 2012 for more detail on age model construction"
